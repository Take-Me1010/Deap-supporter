# Deap-supporter

a useful extension when you use [Deap](https://github.com/deap/deap); a framework for Evolutionary Algorithm.

## Features

This extension provides some useful functions when coding deap in python.

deap.creator.create is useful, however this function dynamically generates python class, so there is no code compliment for its class name and attributes.
Now, if you install this extension, **you are free to compliment them!!**

Deap-supporter supports compliment, detail, a brief documentation and definition jump against
- your classes generated by deap.creator.create()
- your aliases registered by deap.base.ToolBox.register()

Additionally, supports compliment of The attributes (bound the class generated creator.create() ) !
See [example](#example) below.

## Usages

**First of all, load and parse python file.**
Note that this extension activates when you execute commands.

For this, execute the command:'deap-supporter.loadDocument'.(keybinding: ctrl+alt+l)
if there are some valid statements, you can do coding comfortably.

I believe you can make sense easily by reading below example.

### example

you will write...

```python
from deap import base, creator, tools

creator.create('FitnessMax', base.Fitness, weights=(1.0, ))
```

then, execute the command:'deap-supporter.loadDocument' from command pallet.

Well, **keybinding: ctrl+alt+L** is naturally more useful.

After you execute the command, the editor suggests 'FitnessMax' if you type 'creator.' like below.
![./images/compliment-1.jpg](./images/compliment-1.jpg)

This extension provides a brief documentation.
I think it is useful because you can see *its base class* and *its attributes*.

In addition, the editor suggests its attributes with its initial value.
![./images/compliment-2.jpg](./images/compliment-2.jpg)

And now, suppose you add the code below.

```python
creator.create('Individual', list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)
```

If you code additional creator.create(), you should execute 'deap-supporter.loadDocument' (ctrl+alt+L).
Then editor will suggest 'creator.Individual'.

![./images/compliment-3.jpg](./images/compliment-3.jpg)

Note that **your editor never suggests if you forget executing loadDocument command**.

examples above are for creator.create(), but ToolBox.register() is same.
You will write codes like below.
```python
import random
from deap import base, creator, tools

toolbox = base.Toolbox()
toolbox.register('attr_bool', random.randint, 0, 1)
```

Then execute the command for loading, mainly 'deap-supporter.loadDocument' with ctrl+alt+L.
And the editor will suggest toolbox.attr_bool with its equivalent code like below .
![./images/compliment-4.jpg](./images/compliment-4.jpg)

where additional args means the rest of its arguments, as ToolBox.register just do partial application.

If you use another name for the instance of deap.base.ToolBox, you must change settings for this extension. See [Settings](#extension-settings).

### Attention

if your code is invalid like below,

```python
creator.create('Individual', list, 
```
this extension will not load this line.
The rule is that the line
- starts with 'creator.create' (or you can change its value. see [Settings](#extension-settings))
- ends with ')'
- has class name; 'Foo' or "Bar"
if the line does not have class name, throw Error. (will be changed in future version)

Invalid codes examples are
- creator.create('Individual', list, 
  - because the line does not end ')'.
- creator.create(Hoge, fuga)
  - because it has no '' or "".

## Requirements

No special requirements.
you should use the latest version of VScode only.
