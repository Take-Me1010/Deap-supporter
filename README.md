## Features

This extension provides some useful functions when coding deap in python.

deap.creator.create is useful, however this function dynamically generates python class, so there is no code compliment for its class name and attributes.
Now, if you install this extension, **you are free to compliment them!!**

Deap-supporter supports compliment and detail, definition jump below !
- your classes generated by deap.creator.create()
- your aliases registered by deap.base.ToolBox.register()

Additionally, supports compliment of The attributes (bound the class generated creator.create() ) !
See [example](#example) below.

## Usages

**First of all, load and parse python file.**
Note that this extension activates when you execute commands.

For this, execute the command:'deap-supporter.loadDocument'.(keybinding: ctrl+alt+l)
if there are some valid statements, you can do coding comfortably.

I believe you can make sense easily by reading below example.

### example

you will write...

```python
from deap import base, creator, tools

creator.create('FitnessMax', base.Fitness, weights=(1.0, ))
```

then, execute the command:'deap-supporter.loadDocument' from command pallet.

Well, **keybinding: ctrl+alt+L** is naturally more useful.

After you execute the command, the editor suggests 'FitnessMax' if you type 'creator.' like below.

In addition, the editor suggests its attributes with its initial value.
